# Python_Non_AI_Windows_Voice_Control
- Python 3.8.5 was used during creation and local debugging.
- A python code which accepts commands as audio and then executes a command from the commands the programmer has included in the code. 
- This voice assistant also integrates a single node kubernetes cluster(minikube) with python
- One can also perform kubectl operations seamlessly with this assistant
- The code is executable only from the command terminal. 
- Please add the required PATH environment variable names in the README file. I haven't used any commands requiring additional PATH values, but be sure to have python3 in your PATH values as you will require it to run this via the CMD.
# Required PATH values
- [Minikube installation location]/minikube/minikube
- [Kubectl installation location]/kubectl
# Additional INFO
-Enter any additional info below in points(must be easily understandable)-
-Python and its broad variety of libraries are very well suited to develop customized machine learning tools which tackle the complex challenges posed by financial time series.
